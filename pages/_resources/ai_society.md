## 1. What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence by computers. It involves the development of algorithms, software, and hardware to perform tasks like problem-solving, learning, reasoning, perception, and language understanding. Most modern AI systems analyze and process large amounts of data, make decisions, and adapt their behavior based on inputs (data) they receive from their environment.

### Narrow v. General AI
One distinction that is sometimes discussed in the news media is whether AIs are "narrow" or "general":

**Narrow AIs** perform specific tasks within a limited domain, but their skills do not generalize to a new contexts. All **current** applications of AI are generally considered "narrow":

* Search engines (e.g., Google Search)
* Recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, Spotify, and Netflix)
* Speech recognition systems (Siri and Alexa)
* Self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo)
* Generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art)
* Strategic games (e.g., Chess, Go)

**General AI**, also known as "artificial general intelligence," refers to machines or systems that possess human-like typically require human intelligence. This concept is largely theoretical, and is debated among AI researchers and tech figures.

While a minority of AI researchers and techies worry that AI will one day decide to "dominate humanity," the more prevalent worry is that humans will design and deploy AIs recklessly:

> People won't be "smart enough to design super-intelligent machines, yet ridiculously stupid to the point of giving it moronic objectives with no safeguards". -- Yann LeCun (Chief AI Scientist at Meta)

## 3. How do AIs work?
* Goal is established a priori, and then the algorithms are tuned to achieve the goal.
* Many different approaches (list a few here)...

## 4. What are the benefits?
It's important not to dismiss some of the remarkable accomplishments of AI innovations.

## 5. What are the harms and risks?

### Bias

#### Application bias
The goals to which AIs are directed reflect the values, ideologies, and contexts in which they emerge. Given this, while it is possible to pursue any number of socially valuable ends using AI, the direction of AI innovation will likely be tethered to the business models of the main players.
* Which applications of AI are most likely to be pursued? Which are the least likely?
* What kinds of data inform the model (see the library of missing datasets)?

### The Future of Work
