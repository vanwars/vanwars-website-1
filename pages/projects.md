## Current Projects
I currently have two active projects: (1) *creating contexts for social and ethical sensemaking for CS majors*, and (2) *understanding adult computing education pathways*. In the <em>ethical sensemaking</em> project, <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/sepehrvakil/" target="_blank">Sepehr Vakil</a>, Natalie Melo and I are examining some of the ways in which universities can help undergraduates engage with the societal impacts of computing (e.g., through independent study opportunities, <a href="https://www.raiso.org/" <a href="https://nu-tech-ethics.github.io/fall2021/syllabus/" target="_blank">course offerings</a>, service learning experiences, and <a href="https://raiso.substack.com/archive" target="_blank">student-run publications</a>); and whether and how students later integrate social and ethical considerations into their engineering practice.

In the <em>adult computing education pathways</em> project,
I am collaborating with the <a href="https://www.ywca-ens.org/economic-advancement/yw-tech-lab/" target="_blank">YW Tech Lab</a> (of the YWCA Evanston / North Shore) team to better understand the role of technical training programs (e.g., community college certificate programs, bootcamps, community classes, apprenticeship programs) in helping adult learners access tech jobs. This involves understanding teachers' and learners' experiences within these programs, the kinds of supports that are effective in fostering learning and self-efficacy, and how students use their newly aquired tech skills going forward.

### YW Tech Lab
I work with the YWCA Evanston / North Shore to support the <a href="https://www.ywca-ens.org/economic-advancement/yw-tech-lab/" target="_blank">YW Tech Lab Career Academy</a> – a FREE career technical education training program that helps adults in the Evanston / Chicagoland community learn about web design and web development. My roles involve:

* Coordinating a <em>community tutoring program</em> (run by undergraduates).
* Running a <em>Website Practicum</em>, where YW Tech Labs students enhance their technical and design skills by building a real-world website for a local business.
* Organizing a <em>Portfolio Building Workshop</em> to help YW Tech Lab graduates showcase their knowledge and abilities.</li>

We were recently awarded a <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/communityrelations/about/racial-equity-grant.html" target="_blank">Racial Equity & Community Partnership Grant</a> to expand this work.



## Past Projects

### Code 510
During graduate school, I co-founded & directed Code 510 – a creative coding program for high school students. This involved developing and running two 6-week summer coding camps and an after school program to help local youth explore some of the many applications of computer programming.
