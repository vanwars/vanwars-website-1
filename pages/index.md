I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://csci.unca.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the University of North Carolina Asheville. As an educator, I develop and teach courses in human-computer interaction, web design / development, introductory programming, and computing / data ethics. 
As a researcher, I design and study educational interventions that aim to broaden participation in computing, and help emerging computer scientists recognize and engage with the societal and ethical implications of their work. I also build computational tools that support civic advocacy and citizen science initiatives.

Prior to joining UNCA, I was an Assistant Professor of Instruction at Northwestern University, where I co-directed the <a href="https://tree.northwestern.edu">TREE Lab</a> with Sepehr Vakil. My Ph.D. is from the UC Berkeley <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/">School of Information</a>, where I was advised by Tapan Parikh, and worked with Kris Gutiérrez, Paul Duguid, and Coye Cheshire. Before academia, I worked as a software designer/developer, building data and communication systems to support public accountability for city and regional development projects.

        YW Tech Lab Career Academy
    </h3>
    <p>I work with the YWCA Evanston / North Shore to
        support the <a href="https://www.ywca-ens.org/economic-advancement/yw-tech-lab/"
            target="_blank">YW Tech Lab Career Academy</a>
        – a FREE career technical education training program that
        helps adults in the Evanston / Chicagoland community learn about web design and web development.
        My roles involve:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Coordinating a <em>community tutoring program</em> (run by undergraduates).
        </li>
        <li>Running a <em>Website Practicum</em>, where YW Tech Labs students
            enhance their technical and design skills by building a real-world website for a local
            business.
        </li>
        <li>Organizing a <em>Portfolio Building Workshop</em> to help YW Tech Lab graduates showcase
            their knowledge and abilities.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We were recently awarded a <a

        Code 510
    </h3>
    <p>During graduate school, I co-founded & directed Code 510 –
        a creative coding program for
        high school students. This involved developing and running two
        6-week summer coding camps and an after school program to help
        local youth explore some of the many applications of computer
        programming.

# Projects
I currently have two active projects: (1) *creating contexts for social and ethical sensemaking for CS majors*, and (2) *understanding adult computing education pathways*. In the <em>ethical sensemaking</em> project, <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/sepehrvakil/" target="_blank">Sepehr Vakil</a>, Natalie Melo and I are examining some of the ways in which universities can help undergraduates engage with the societal impacts of computing (e.g., through independent study opportunities, <a href="https://www.raiso.org/" <a href="https://nu-tech-ethics.github.io/fall2021/syllabus/" target="_blank">course offerings</a>, service learning experiences, and <a href="https://raiso.substack.com/archive" target="_blank">student-run publications</a>); and whether and how students later integrate social and ethical considerations into their engineering practice.

In the <em>adult computing education pathways</em> project,
I am collaborating with the <a href="https://www.ywca-ens.org/economic-advancement/yw-tech-lab/" target="_blank">YW Tech Lab</a> (of the YWCA Evanston / North Shore) team to better understand the role of technical training programs (e.g., community college certificate programs, bootcamps, community classes, apprenticeship programs) in helping adult learners access tech jobs. This involves understanding teachers' and learners' experiences within these programs, the kinds of supports that are effective in fostering learning and self-efficacy, and how students use their newly aquired tech skills going forward.
